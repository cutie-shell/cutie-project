Cutie Shell aims to be a pretty and easy-to-use mobile UI/UX for Linux devices running either Halium or mainline Linux. Our UI is inspired by Jolla's Sailfish OS, but we are not aiming for a clone. One major difference to Saifish OS is that our source is completely open.

The project is still heavily under development and is pre-alpha quality. This means it is not yet ready for most end-users, but we are welcoming any interested developers to contribute and share their thoughts. For reference, you can find a feature matrix of what we have [here](/progress). 

We also offer daily Droidian builds containing a development snapshot of Cutie Shell and the base apps for easy testing.
