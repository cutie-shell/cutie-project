### [View Development Progress](/progress.md)

Cutie Shell aims to be a good-looking mobile UI for Linux devices, either via Halium or mainline Linux. Our UI style is inspired by Sailfish OS UI, but it is  not meant to look exactly the same and it is completely FOSS unlike Sailfish OS.

The project is still heavily under development and is pre-alpha quality. This means it is not yet ready for end-users, but we are welcoming any interested developers to contribute and share their thoughts.
